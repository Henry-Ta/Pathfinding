## General info
Pathfinding is a grid based project that visualize paths of searching algorithms, written in pygame.
## Installation
Requires [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [pygame](https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted) installed locally.

To run this project, open cmd (Windows)/ terminal (Linux) and run:
